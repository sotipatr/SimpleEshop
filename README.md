# Simple_E-shop
This is a simple e-shop application that uses a mySQL DB to store the offers of a merchant.
For this implementation the Glassfih Server has been used to host the app.
The assumptions that should be taken under consideration are firstly that when an offer has been expired, it is no longer shown in the app, but it is still stored in the DB with an inactive sattus. Also, for the sake of simplicity the duration of the time of offer validity is defined in minutes. Finally, it is been considered that there is only one merchant (user) that uses the app.
